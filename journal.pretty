He’s more equipped to patrol a castle than trek through the jungle, a magnificent suit of armor and a battleaxe that screams “I’m compensating for my small tusks”. He’s quiet, I can only assume due to his limited vocabulary and mental capacity.",
    "Yorben couldn’t be any more different from Craavor. Thin, lanky, and refuses to shut up. He’s clearly had some sordid past, his insinuations are about as subtle as a rampaging owlbear. Quick hands and a silver tongue all wrapped up in a hooded leather jerkin. I’m sure he’s older than I am but it can’t be by much. Out of all of us, he’s the one I can’t figure out why he’s here. His type makes money in far more nefarious manners, they’re not likely to spend time and risk their neck earning what could be taken.",
    "Zal doesn’t seem to be wearing any armor, or carrying much of anything. He’s dressed in a simple cloth robe. He’s been sitting quietly with his eyes closed for this whole journey. I asked him what he was doing once but all he said was he was “quieting his mind to listen within”. Whatever that means. I think he wants to quiet more than his mind though, there’s a small vein on his temple that starts pounding whenever Yorben starts to talk louder.",

They started streaming into the camp, there were so many I thought we were going to be overrun. Then Craavor stood up and started talking to them. The fact that he gave more than just a grunt was shocking enough, but he proved himself surprisingly articulate. He apologized to the leader of the dryads, made reparations and got us some information on the surrounding land. There’s some sort of village a day or so away from here, populated by savages. The dryads say the inhabitants are nothing like us, so perhaps it goblins or some other kind of monster."

As soon as we were in range, several frog like creatures jumped down on us from above, attacking us. From what we could understand, we had disturbed their slave labor force. We did our best to fight back, but it soon became apparent that we were going to be outnumbered, so we turned and fled. We’ve made camp and we’re all alright now.

When Zal agreed with me Yorben made a joke about his height again and Zal lost his temper once again. I thought he was going to bring the entire jungle down on us, but Craavor stepped forward and clamped a hand over his mouth. He told Yorben we weren’t going back and started packing up.

It took us a good couple of hits before we managed to knock them down. Zal took one of them down with some amazing control of the elements but got hit just as hard when the second one moved in. I thought he was dead and gone, but Craavor crushed the statue and ran over to Zal and got him back on his feet somehow. After that, the only thing left were three larger statues. None of them moved towards us, though the center one said something in a language I couldn’t understand, even with my magic. The danger apparently passed, we camped in the ruins for the night."

    "Never doing that again. Despite our best efforts we couldn’t completely clear the temple, though we did slay the Abomination and hopefully disrupted its plan. Of what we could see, they’re attempting some sort of summoning for some kind of demon. Not that they seemed close, the amount of energy they’re trying to pull in using those ancient techniques would easily take a year. Tomorrow we do what we were sent here to do and finish mapping the sector so we can get out of this jungle and head back to the closest thing to civilization."

The dreams I have now are more like repeating memories. Hell would be preferable to this. Every day I can feel my patron pushing on my mind, trying to tell me something. Wish I knew what. Or maybe I do. Right now I can feel it pusing my hand. Leading me to write this entry. Deciding what I should write. Either that or I’m crazy. Alternatively, I’m on the brink of understanding.

    "We spent the day camping in the forest, just sitting around and talking. I haven’t had my head feel this clear in ages, its my own mind, my own hand writing this entry. I know what we need to do. Much as Craavor’s divine direction speaks to him, so my patron speaks to me. We need to go to the Temple of the Worldeater and stop the high priests from summoning the demon they’re trying to drag into the world. This is a terrifying idea, but I have seen what will come if we don’t succeed.",
    "I never realized, in these past few weeks, the kind of people I am traveling with. I thought Yorben a blowhard braggart, but he only told stories when I was quiet and withdrawn, and they always ended with him in some hilariously compromising postion. I thought Zalver a small man, seeking peace but unable to contain his inner rage, but his anger comes from fearing for our safety and his desire to see justice in the world. And then there’s Craavor. I thought everytime he stepped into a fight ahead of me he was trying to prove something, I thought his mindless devotion to his mission meant we were expendable to him, I thought we were merely a means to his ends. But I can see every scar he got from shielding us, I see how he scarifices and compromises his mission to see us safetly home time and again.",
    "I thought by submitting to my patron I could unlock my true potential, but here I sit, writing in a coded journal filled with entries of how inept my party members are, stuffed to the brim with my own paranoia. I let another’s fears and desires overtake me, the same as when I lived in father’s house back home. No more. We save the world now and then Craavor and I head home"

    "We’re heading north, Craavor thinks theres another temple there. It’s not the worldeater’s one, but stopping these minor ones from supplying life force to it will help all the same. We had some small trouble with small scaly dinosaurs, but it was no great deal. Yorben called them “checken feckers”. He was shocked when I started laughing, I guess I haven’t done that a great deal on this trip. I spent most of the walk today telling them about home, about how boring the court was for a young lady and how I dreaded being sold off to breed and bake. I told them about the crazy street witch who gave me the ability to talk to my patron and the gang and the casino and all of it. It felt good to talk, to open up, to reveal who I was. When I told them about my common born mother Yorben started laughing. When I asked why he told me it was because he had thought I was the only one not a half, but as a half noble then I complete the party- The Party of Halves. Zal said he thought the Uncompleted Party sounded better, but Craavor laughed and said we all completed each other. He’s right."
